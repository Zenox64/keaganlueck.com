            <sneakpeek class="large">What has influenced my artistic decisions are personal experiences. I am constantly trying to educate myself further. I have realized that when I learn something new that my mind appreciates it highlights these things when I see them out in the natural world. I become more aware of this new thing and that is what my first project was created to depict. I think that others will interpret it in some way but I do not think everyone will understand. Not everyone has next-level thinking abilities and just takes things for what they are instead of trying to depict the true meaning of a piece of artwork. I know line is a principle of art and I painted a big black line across the entirety of the canvas to contrast the opposite sides. My focal point is the wide open book almost shining on the bigger and brighter side. I think your eyes are drawn to that first thing when looking at this piece. Another principle of art is contrast, which is clearly a principle of this piece. There are two opposite sides separated by a black line. I also put emphasis on the new learning part of the work by painting that in brighter and more attractive colors. <i><a href="blog(5-22-21).html" style="color: #0066CC">read more</a></i></sneakpeek>

            <sneakpeek class="large">As I am writing this I am two caprisuns deep, figured I shouldn’t have anymore pop tonight because I had three or four free refills at work. I wanted to talk about the last two weeks I had at school and what better time to blog that than at midnight on a Friday night when I have to work in the morning. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, motivation is a wild thing it comes and goes at weird times. So let me set the stage for you guys. I am a straight A student 4.0 every quarter, almost, getting good grades is always easy for me but sometimes I am not always the best behavior wise. The week started out with me selling waters; this would probably be the 5th of April. I started selling waters because I found it as a really easy way to make money. The school used to sell waters but they stopped selling them even tho they got so much business. I do not know if they stopped selling waters because of covid or not but my guess is it was because of covid just like anything else these days. Not to mislead you, life is still good. So the school used to sell so many waters a day but then stopped giving me the easiest opportunity to make some cash. You can buy a 24 pack of waters for $3 and if you sell them for $0.50 a piece you make an easy $9 in profit. You can definitely attract more customers if you sell them cold, this was actually not hard. What I did was bring a normal larger sized lunch cooler, put it in the bottom of my locker and then froze 3 of the 14 or so waters that I brought and use those to keep the internals of the cooler cold. So like I said it is April 5th, I had started selling waters a few weeks prior and sold a water to one of my buddys, he proceeded to throw it at the wall because he bought a frozen one. Well, it exploded... <i><a href="blog(5-22-21).html" style="color: #0066CC">read more</a></i></sneakpeek>
