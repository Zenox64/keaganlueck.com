                <li>Two basically different styles of blackjack are played in the casinos; single or double deck "pitch" games dealt from the dealer's hand -- and four to eight deck "shoe" games. The shoe games outnumber hand held blackjack by about a 10 to 1 ratio.</li>
            <li>All else being equal, the fewer the decks used, the better the percentages are for the player -- even if he doesn't keep track of the cards.</li>
            <li>In some casinos the dealer must stand on all 17s, adn in other he must hit a "soft" 17. It's moderately better for the player if the dealer stands with this hand.</li>
            <li>The options the player may use to manage his hands are hitting, standing, doubling down, splitting, taking insurance and in some casinos, surrendering.</li>
        <li>Most poor players think the surrender option is a sucker play, but good players understand that it can be used to their advantage.</li>
