      <post>As I am writing this I am two caprisuns deep, figured I shouldn’t have anymore pop tonight because I had three or four free refills at work. I wanted to talk about the last two weeks I had at school and what better time to blog that than at midnight on a Friday night when I have to work in the morning. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, motivation is a wild thing it comes and goes at weird times. So let me set the stage for you guys. I am a straight A student 4.0 every quarter, almost, getting good grades is always easy for me but sometimes I am not always the best behavior wise. The week started out with me selling waters; this would probably be the 5th of April. I started selling waters because I found it as a really easy way to make money. The school used to sell waters but they stopped selling them even tho they got so much business. I do not know if they stopped selling waters because of covid or not but my guess is it was because of covid just like anything else these days. Not to mislead you, life is still good. So the school used to sell so many waters a day but then stopped giving me the easiest opportunity to make some cash. You can buy a 24 pack of waters for $3 and if you sell them for $0.50 a piece you make an easy $9 in profit. You can definitely attract more customers if you sell them cold, this was actually not hard. What I did was bring a normal larger sized lunch cooler, put it in the bottom of my locker and then froze 3 of the 14 or so waters that I brought and use those to keep the internals of the cooler cold. So like I said it is April 5th, I had started selling waters a few weeks prior and sold a water to one of my buddys, he proceeded to throw it at the wall because he bought a frozen one. Well, it exploded and got the floor nice and slick which had the affect of three middle schoolers slipping. My principal found out about this, I have no idea how, and blamed me for it. I asked her how it was any different if the school sold it, she didn’t provide a good reason and told me I have to stop unless I gave the profit to the school(that is literally what she said). She knew I would not be giving the money to the school, I am not going to take a deficit no matter what. I thought her saying that was stupid and I still had a 24 pack of water that I had already bought so I kept selling the waters. Everything was going good and I was selling completely out several days. These same two weeks me and my buddies where playing a game where we ripped down a bunch of these stupid covid awareness and social distancing signs. It was fun and give us an adrenaline rush while doing the school a favor of getting rid of an eye sore that is supposed to tell me how to behave. I think that the record of the amount of signs collected in a day was 20 or so. We decided to start putting all the signs we collected in an empty locker to see how many we really collected in total. None of us ever got caught for doing this, no one really had a clue. These two weeks I believe I was acting pretty wild, I calmed myself down don’t worry. One day at lunch Garret Wiese said he thought he had some disease or something, I don’t 100% remember but I said that I thought he actually he had ligma, Dane who was setting me up said, “What’s ligma”, I then of course answered with, “ligma balls”. This happens as our teacher is leaving and our lunch monitor is coming in but of course my teacher hears it and it just completely ticks him off. It was honestly pretty funny in the moment. As a result of covid our school designed this hallway plan which makes some of the halls one ways. Me and my buddies are walking down the hall the right way like respectable young men. I get thirsty and pull my mask down to take drink of my water. A para that is one of those people that abuse power says to me “No drinking water in the hallway”. I said “What???”. She says the same thing. It was the stupidest thing I have ever heard and the funniest part about it is that she is walking the wrong way in the hallway. Like how big of a hypocrite can you be. Lets fastforward to the end of these two weeks where a lot of action happens. My buddy Ryan Kevelin through a cup of gravy that he got for lunch in an empty locker. My principal was walking in this hallway and must have smelt it and wanted to check it out. She wanted to find out who did it so she checked out the security cameras. I think you can piece together why this is bad news for me. So we are in English, the last class of the day, reading To Kill a Mockingbird and my principal comes in and takes me out of class. She brings me to the lockers and asks me if I had anything to do with the gravy thing and I answered truthfully, “No”. Then she asks me to open MY locker, it only goes down hill from here. She sees a big cup of cash in it with a water cooler in the bottom and tells me all about how she already told me to stop and how she will be calling my parents to figure out a punishment. So I am pretty worried that I am not going to have an enjoyable time when I get home. The final bell rings and my principal comes out of the school running after me. She tells me that she talked to my mom and they agreed I should serve detention that day(Tuesday the 20th). I go into the library to serve the detention which actually was not that bad except for the fact I had to listen to the librarian talk to someone about having to put her dog down after she got done with detention. I actually felt bad for her, she was crying. While I am in detention working on some school work that I know I will be missing tomorrow my principal walks in. She said she looked at my behavior report and told me that I had a behavior incident that same day at lunch for prank calling. I was not really even apart of the prank calling that Cooper and Dane were doing, I was just listening to it and it was super funny. They were doing some deez nuts jokes. She gives me the talk about how I am such a respectful kid and asking me if there is something wrong because I have been acting weird lately. Whatever the good old speech. So detention is over and I start walking home, I get home and I start mowing the lawn right away because the later I had to deal with my dads wrath the better. I get done mowing the lawn and my mom is still not home. My dad asked me why I was home late, he was playing dumb he already knew, I told him detention and I told him the whole story on how I didn’t listen and she told me to stop and I didn’t. He told me that I need to obey people in charge. He said him and my mom will discuss my punishment and let me know later. They tell me that the punishment is I can’t take my phone to a three hour shift. I have it work in two days. That was the easiest punishment ever, I was so relieved. I didn’t care if the took my phone. It was my PC that I was worried about. To sum it up I ended up making about $45 profit on the waters, it was so easy. I basically made about $90 an hour because I had to serve a 30 minute detention. It is the next day(Wednesday the 21st)  the day our school would be performing a mock car crash which I am taking place in. There were three people particaptating each having a different outcome. One person walked away fine, one person was injured and taken off the scene with an ambulance and one person died. I was  the person they chose to die. It was weird. I was in the back of this car that they drove up to the scene and then started hitting with a sledgehammer to make it look like it got into a crash with a tractor. There was a tractor right in front of it. It was super cold this day. I went into the backseat of this car and they gave me a wool blanket to cover up with to keep me warm and to protect me from shards of glass. The entire high school starts coming out to watch so we get into position. We have an MC walking through what is going on and then it is my time to shine. They start ripping the car apart with the jaws of life. They ripped off both passenger side doors and the roof of the vehicle. They take me out and put me on a stretcher and act like they are trying to resuscitate me for five minutes. Then they pronounce me dead on the scene call in the hearse and put me in a body bag(it was not used, it was brand new). Then they put me in the back of the hearse while in a body bag. It was one of the weirdest things ever. They wanted to make it look as real as possible to show the students what can happen with distracted driving. I am probably one of the few people on planet earth that can say they have been in the back of a hearse before. It was cool because they gave me the rest of the school day off. Me and dad went to Burger King for lunch. The rest of the week was pretty chill.</p>
