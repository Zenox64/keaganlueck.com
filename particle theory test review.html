    <h1><u>5 particle theory rules</u></h1>
    <ol>
      <li>All Matter is composed of particles</li>
      <li>
        The particles of one substance are the same. The particles of a
        different substance are made of different particles.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are attracticle forces between particles, the closer they are the
        stronger the force of attraction
      </li>
      <li>Particles are always moving</li>
      <li>
        The more energy particles have, the faster they move and the higher
        their temperature.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      If energy is added or taken away, the substance can change its state.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      All matter in the universe can be classified into two basic catgories:
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mixtures: Matter that consists of two or more substances mixed together
        but not chemicall bonded. Ex-> Concrete, sugar water, cereal and milk
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Homogeneous mixture: identical properties throughout the object. Ex->
          tap water, sugar/milk, saltware.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heterogenous mixture: different properties at different locations
          through the object. Ex-> concrete, pizza, soup
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <span
          title="Pure substances can be elements or compounds and have on phase."
          >Pure Subtances: Matter that consists of one substance on its own or
          chemically bonded together. Ex-> Gold, pure water, carbon
          dioxide.</span
        >
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>
      Elements: simplest pure substance. Cannot be chemically altered into
      smaller substances.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The smallest part of an element that still posses the properties of the
        element is an atom.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Periodic table: Each element can be found on the periodic table. Each
      element has a chemical symbol.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Compounds: Pure substances that are not always single elements. Pure
      substances that are made up of more than one element. ex-> C02 H20.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The properties of a compound: properties of a compound are different than
      the individual elements that it makes up. Ex-> Salt NaCl.
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Na: Sodium is a metal that is explosive in water.</li>
      <li>Cl: a green, posionous gas.</li>
      <p>These two combined make table salt that we use daily.</p>
    </ul>
    <h2><u>Classification of matter flow chart.</u></h2>
    <img src="classification of matter flow chart.jpg" />
    <p>Solid: definite shape and volume.</p>
    <p>Liquid: definite volume but changes shape.</p>
    <p>Gas: no definite shape or volume.</p>
    <p>
      Plasma: plasma is found in tvs but is very commonly found in stare. Plasma
      is everwhere in outer space and is technically the most common state of
      matter.
