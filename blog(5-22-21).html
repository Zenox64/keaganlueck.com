      <post>Taking a weekend trip to Florida is really fun. So I get home from school at 12:10 on Friday the 14th and my dad asks me if there are any upcoming Starlink launches, I didn’t know. He was asking because his friends Monica and Nate were in Cocoa Beach Florida for their 10th year wedding anniversary, Cocoa Beach is really close to Kennedy Space Center(where Spacex Launches their Starlink Missions from). I didn’t really think much about it and went downstairs to practice piano and work on my website. The Starlink-26 mission was scheduled to launch on Saturday and his friends were planning on leaving that day, my dad told them they should stay and watch the launch. They text him back and say that they are going to stay for the launch. They also say we should come down(not thinking we would). My dad gets interested and starts looking at flights. Turns out we could fly down there on Delta for $97 each round trip. We would have a place to stay out so it kinda would have worked perfectly. He calls down for me and says, “wanna go to Florida?”.I am obviously down to go to Florida and my mom was okay with us leaving so we booked the flights, the flight departs at 6:00pm it is about 2:00pm at the time. I go downstairs and start packing. I told Kendra, “I think we are going to Florida soon”. First she has heard of anything going on. We get all packed up and ready to go and we just tell Kendra we are going to Florida and we leave. I was supposed to work that Saturday so I asked Cooper to work for me and right as we are about to leave he said he could work for me. Everything is working out perfectly. We didn’t really have a plan on what we are going to do once we landed in Orlando because Cocoa Beach is about an hour away. My dad texts his buddy Kevin and asks him if he wants to pick us up at the airport at about 10, expecting for him to laugh it off. He responds with “Sure”. Well that is awesome because we were gonna have to pay at least $100/a day for a rental car and we get to see Kevin. I drove the whole way to the Shepherd Road. We go to shepherd road and park for $12 a day and take the shuttle to the airport. Everything is still working out perfectly because the shuttle was ready to go right when we were ready. We go to the airport and wait for about 25 minutes in line for security. We passed security and we went to the bathroom and from the bathroom we hop right on the flight. Once we sit down on the flight we think it is so awesome that we will be in Florida in 3 hours. Once we land we walk outside to find Kevin, it was so nice outside. We find Kevin and we walk into his car and he is playing Baby Shark, it was pretty funny. He is so happy to see us and we are also happy to see him. We wanted to get some snacks so we go to a 7-Eleven and there is a biker gang of about 60 bikers. That biker gang was just loitering at the 7-Eleven, not really something you see in Minnesota. Kevin is looking for a gas pump and he drives around the pumps about 5 times and then finds a spot and squeezes in between a big Ford Expedition, all the bikers are watching us at this point. Once he squeezes in he realizes he didn’t even need gas, it was hilarious. I got a slushie at the 7-Eleven of course, that slushy was so good. The drive to Cocoa Beach with Kevin was fun, it was fun catching up with him. We meet Monica and Nate at the bar they are at. It is the day of their anniversary. My dad was in the wedding and I was the ring bearer.  They had burgers ordered for us and we were starving. Kevin stays for about 45 minutes. We catch up with Monica and Nate for a bit and then we go back to their condo. The condo was nice. It was right on the beach and they even had an extra bedroom with two queen beds so that was perfect for me and my dad. I was pretty tired so I talked with them for a bit and then went to bed. It was about 2:00 am when I went to bed and we had to be out of the condo by 10:00am the next morning. They stay up and talk for a bit and then they go to bed. I wake up last and take a shower then we are pretty much ready to leave. We went to eat breakfast at the Sunrise Diner. I got pancakes. We figured out what we wanted to do before the launch which was scheduled for 6:58pm. Some guy told Monica and Nate about a nature reserve. We decided to check that out after breakfast and we got to see some gators. After the nature reserve we wanted to go to Kennedy Space Center to see if we could go see Falcon 9. My dad gets a text from Kevin on the way to Kennedy asking if they should come down for the launch. Of course they should. We plan on them coming down for the launch. My dad, Nate and I go into Kennedy. Monica stays in the car and takes a nap. We go in and realize all we can really do is go to the gift shop or pay $57 a person to go in for an hour. It is 3pm at the time and they close at 4pm. We decided to go check out the gift shop and we got a bumper sticker. They had a sweet SpaceX/Falcon 9 tee shirt there but I am not really the person to ask for my dad to buy me something. After the gift shop we left the gift shop and got back in the car. We wanted to see if we could see Falcon 9 up close so we tried driving back to where it was. We didn’t get very far before getting stopped by security. We left Kennedy Space Center and started heading back to the hotel to try and get checked in. We got checked in and then we went to the Playalinda Brewery, this place was really cool and they were all interested about the launch there. They had this craft root beer that was brewed in house and boy was that delicious. So after about two or three rootbeers and a few appetizers we left to go back to the hotel to meet Kevin and his family at 5. We got back to the hotel and Kevin and fam were just pulling in. We hung out for a while at the pool before the launch. Then we got to the 5th floor and went to the Launch Viewing Room. It was so cool the hotel had a built in Launch Viewing Room. It had glass sliding doors that opened up to a balcony. We had a straight on view of Launchpad 39a but we could not see Falcon 9 because it was hidden behind all the NASA buildings of sorts. At this point it was about T-20 minutes. We were tuned into the SpaceX livestream and making sure everything is still a go. The launch was awesome, it was one of the coolest things I had ever seen. The rocket looked like it was flying to the left but really it was just the Earth spinning. After the launch we went to Dixie Crossroads, there was an hour long wait so we waited at the bar. After the buzzer went off we sat down to eat and after we ordered it took about another hour to get our food. We ordered a dozen of standard broiled shrimp and a dozen of rock shrimp. The restaurant was pretty good. The photos on the walls of the restaurants were pretty cool. They had a signed photo of Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins. There was also a very cool picture of one of the few Falcon Heavy Launches. Man it must have been crazy down there when Falcon Heavy was launched. Then we said goodbye to the Switzers. We all went to bed at about 10pm that night and woke up at 5am. My dad and I’s flight departed at 8:55. It took about 20 minutes to get through security and then we had about and hour to burn before we departed. We ate subway in Glencoe and got back in time for me to mow two lawns and my piano recital.</post>
