            <sneakpeek class="large">Taking a weekend trip to Florida is really fun. So I get home from school at 12:10 on Friday the 14th and my dad asks me if there are any upcoming Starlink launches, I didn’t know. He was asking because his friends Monica and Nate were in Cocoa Beach Florida for their 10th year wedding anniversary, Cocoa Beach is really close to Kennedy Space Center(where SpaceX Launches their Starlink Missions from). I didn’t really think much about it and went downstairs to practice piano and work on my website. The Starlink-26 mission was scheduled to launch on Saturday and his friends were planning on leaving that day, my dad told them they should stay and watch the launch. They text him back and say that they are going to stay for the launch. They also say we should come down(not thinking we would). My dad gets interested and starts looking at flights. Turns out we could fly down there on Delta for $97 each round trip. We would have a place to stay out so it kinda would have worked perfectly. He calls down for me and says, “wanna go to Florida?". I am obviously down to go to Florida and my mom was okay with us leaving so we booked the flights, the flight departs at 6:00pm it is about 2:00pm at the time. I go downstairs and start packing. I told Kendra, “I think we are going to Florida soon”. First she has heard of anything going on. We get all packed up and ready to go and we just tell Kendra we are going to Florida and we leave. I was supposed to work that Saturday so I asked Cooper to work for me and right as we are about to leave he said he could work for me. Everything is working out perfectly. We didn’t really have a plan on what we are going to do once we landed in Orlando because Cocoa Beach is about an hour away. My dad texts his buddy Kevin...<i><a href="blog(5-22-21).html" style="color: #0066CC">read more</a></i></sneakpeek>

            <sneakpeek class="large">As I am writing this I am two caprisuns deep, figured I shouldn’t have anymore pop tonight because I had three or four free refills at work. I wanted to talk about the last two weeks I had at school and what better time to blog that than at midnight on a Friday night when I have to work in the morning. Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, motivation is a wild thing it comes and goes at weird times. So let me set the stage for you guys. I am a straight A student 4.0 every quarter, almost, getting good grades is always easy for me but sometimes I am not always the best behavior wise. The week started out with me selling waters; this would probably be the 5th of April. I started selling waters because I found it as a really easy way to make money. The school used to sell waters but they stopped selling them even tho they got so much business. I do not know if they stopped selling waters because of covid or not but my guess is it was because of covid just like anything else these days. Not to mislead you, life is still good. So the school used to sell so many waters a day but then stopped giving me the easiest opportunity to make some cash. You can buy a 24 pack of waters for $3 and if you sell them for $0.50 a piece you make an easy $9 in profit. You can definitely attract more customers if you sell them cold, this was actually not hard. What I did was bring a normal larger sized lunch cooler, put it in the bottom of my locker and then froze 3 of the 14 or so waters that I brought and use those to keep the internals of the cooler cold. So like I said it is April 5th, I had started selling waters a few weeks prior and sold a water to one of my buddys, he proceeded to throw it at the wall because he bought a frozen one. Well, it exploded... <i><a href="blog(4-20-21).html" style="color: #0066CC">read more</a></i></sneakpeek>
